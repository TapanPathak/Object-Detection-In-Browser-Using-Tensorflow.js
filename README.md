# Object Detection In Browser Using Tensorflow.js

The Objective is to create a webpage that uses machine learning directly in the web browser via **TensorFlow.js** to classify and detect common objects, (including more than one at a time), from a live webcam stream in real time. 

Not only will we know that the image contains an object, but we can also get the coordinates of the bounding box for each object it finds, which allows you to highlight the found object in the image as shown in the example below.
